# AR7 Multi-Model Climate Assessment Comparison

A comprehensive framework for generating and evaluating draft climate assessment reports using multiple Large Language Models (LLMs), demonstrating transparent experimentation with AI involvement in scientific communication.

## Overview

This script generates complete drafts of the IPCC AR7 Working Group II climate assessment report (29 chapters, 330K+ words) using seven different AI models, then carries out a fact-checking loop, quality scoring, and multi-model comparison.

**Key Achievement**: Provides a framework for evaluating potential LLM contributions to climate assessment reviews.

**Not in Scope**: 

- This project does not aim to replace human expertise in climate science.
- This project does not carry out direct analysis of data or models.
- This project does not create images, tables, charts, or visualizations.

## 🌍 Benefits to Global Publics, Science, and Policy

### For Global Publics

**1. Democratization of Scientific Knowledge**
- Makes complex climate science more accessible through AI-assisted synthesis
- Enables rapid generation of assessment summaries in multiple languages
- Reduces time from research to public-facing reports from years to hours

**2. Transparency and Trust**

- **Consistency checking**: Multi-model generation reveals contradictions in literature
- **Gap identification**: Comparison highlights areas needing more research

**2. Methodological Innovation**
- **Reproducible assessment pipelines**: Exact same prompts generate comparable outputs
- **Quality metrics**: Objective evaluation of synthesis quality (1-7 Likert scales)
- **Citation requirements**: V2 prompts enforce evidence-based claims with full references

**3. Enhanced Peer Review**
- AI-generated drafts provide starting points for expert refinement
- **Fact-checking frameworks** catch errors before human review
- **Cross-model validation**: Different models check each other's work

### For Policy

**1. Timely Decision Support**
- **Near-instant synthesis** of latest research for urgent policy questions
- **Scenario exploration**: Quick generation of assessment variants for different policy contexts
- **Evidence accessibility**: Direct citations link claims to peer-reviewed sources

**2. Improved Assessment Quality**
- **Objective quality metrics** (accuracy, IPCC compliance, comprehensiveness)
- **Multi-perspective analysis**: Models from different providers/nations offer diverse viewpoints
- **Consistency**: Automated generation ensures uniform style and structure

**3. Cost Efficiency**
- **Reduced assessment costs**: $5-20 vs millions for traditional IPCC assessments
- **Faster updates**: Weeks instead of years for assessment cycles
- **Resource allocation**: Frees human experts for high-value validation and refinement

## 🎯 Transparency Principles

### 1. Open Methodology
- **All prompts publicly available** (see `prompts/`)
- **Evaluation criteria documented** (7-point Likert scales with justifications)
- **Model configurations transparent** (exact model IDs and parameters)

### 2. Rigorous Evaluation
- **Fact-checking**: Every model output evaluated for errors
- **Quality scoring**: Multi-dimensional assessment (accuracy, style, intelligence)
- **Comparative analysis**: Models ranked objectively on performance

### 3. Limitations Acknowledged
- **AI hallucinations documented**: Fact-check reports show specific errors
- **Quality variations noted**: Some models fail to meet standards
- **Human validation required**: AI is tool for acceleration, not replacement

### 4. Reproducibility
- **All code open source**
- **Exact prompts preserved**
- **Results fully documented** with statistics and examples

## 📖 Sample Output Comparison

To illustrate the differences between models, here is the opening of the Summary for Policymakers from two top-performing models:

### Google Gemini Pro (7.00/7 Quality Score)

> Of course. As a Coordinating Lead Author for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Working Group II, I will now provide the Summary for Policymakers...
> 
> **A. Observed Impacts and Projected Risks**
>
> A.1. Climate change has caused widespread adverse impacts and related losses and damages to nature and people. Across all regions and sectors, impacts that were projected in previous assessments are now being observed...

### OpenAI GPT-5 (6.43/7 Quality Score)

>
> **A. Current State and Observed Impacts**
> 
> A.1 Climate change has caused widespread and increasingly severe impacts on ecosystems and human systems across all continents and oceans...

**Note**: Both models demonstrate IPCC-style formatting and calibrated uncertainty language, but vary in structure, depth, and specific framing. Full chapters available in `output/production_release/`.
