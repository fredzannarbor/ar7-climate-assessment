# AR7 Multi-Model Climate Assessment Comparison

A comprehensive framework for generating and evaluating draft climate assessment reports using multiple Large Language Models (LLMs), demonstrating transparent experimentation with AI involvement in scientific communication.

## Overview

This script generates complete drafts of the IPCC AR7 Working Group II climate assessment report (29 chapters, 330K+ words) using seven different AI models, then carries out a fact-checking loop, quality scoring, and multi-model comparison.

**Key Achievement**: Provides a framework for evaluating potential LLM contributions to climate assessment reviews.

**Not in Scope**: 

At present:

- This project does not aim to replace human expertise in climate science.
- This project does not carry out direct analysis of data or models.
- This project does not create images, tables, charts, or visualizations.
- No user acceptance testing has been conducted.
- All generated content requires expert validation.

## 🌍 Benefits to Global Publics, Science, and Policy

### For Global Publics

**1. Democratization of Scientific Knowledge**
- Makes complex climate science more accessible through AI-assisted synthesis
- Enables rapid generation of assessment summaries in multiple languages
- Reduces time from research to public-facing reports from years to hours

**2. Transparency and Trust**
- **Open evaluation frameworks** show exactly how AI content is generated and validated
- **Multi-model comparison** reveals strengths and weaknesses of different approaches
- **Fact-checking results** publicly document accuracy and limitations
- **Quality scoring** provides objective metrics for assessment reliability

**3. Accelerated Climate Communication**
- Faster synthesis of emerging research for policymakers
- Ability to quickly update assessments as new evidence emerges
- Multiple perspectives (USA, Europe, China) for global representation

### For Science

**1. Research Acceleration**
- **Rapid literature synthesis**: AI can process thousands of papers to identify key findings
- **Consistency checking**: Multi-model generation reveals contradictions in literature
- **Gap identification**: Comparison highlights areas needing more research

**2. Methodological Innovation**
- **Reproducible assessment pipelines**: Exact same prompts generate comparable outputs
- **Quality metrics**: Objective evaluation of synthesis quality (1-7 Likert scales)
- **Citation requirements**: V2 prompts enforce evidence-based claims with full references

**3. Enhanced Peer Review**
- AI-generated drafts provide starting points for expert refinement
- **Fact-checking frameworks** catch errors before human review
- **Cross-model validation**: Different models check each other's work

### For Policy

**1. Timely Decision Support**
- **Near-instant synthesis** of latest research for urgent policy questions
- **Scenario exploration**: Quick generation of assessment variants for different policy contexts
- **Evidence accessibility**: Direct citations link claims to peer-reviewed sources

**2. Improved Assessment Quality**
- **Objective quality metrics** (accuracy, IPCC compliance, comprehensiveness)
- **Multi-perspective analysis**: Models from different providers/nations offer diverse viewpoints
- **Consistency**: Automated generation ensures uniform style and structure

**3. Cost Efficiency**
- **Reduced assessment costs**: $5-20 vs millions for traditional IPCC assessments
- **Faster updates**: Weeks instead of years for assessment cycles
- **Resource allocation**: Frees human experts for high-value validation and refinement

## 🎯 Transparency Principles

### 1. Open Methodology
- **All prompts publicly available** (see `prompts/`)
- **Evaluation criteria documented** (7-point Likert scales with justifications)
- **Model configurations transparent** (exact model IDs and parameters)

### 2. Rigorous Evaluation
- **Fact-checking**: Every model output evaluated for errors
- **Quality scoring**: Multi-dimensional assessment (accuracy, style, intelligence)
- **Comparative analysis**: Models ranked objectively on performance

### 3. Limitations Acknowledged
- **AI hallucinations documented**: Fact-check reports show specific errors
- **Quality variations noted**: Some models fail to meet standards
- **Human validation required**: AI is tool for acceleration, not replacement

### 4. Reproducibility
- **All code open source**
- **Exact prompts preserved**
- **Results fully documented** with statistics and examples
